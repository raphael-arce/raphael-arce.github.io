import Example1 from "./components/example-1/Root";

_TLDR: Extract state from components, don't lift it up._

<hr />

I have a love-hate relationship with React.
I often think it is a wonderful library, making it easy to get started with something.
Before you know it, you've gone down a rabbit hole and have built something marvelous.

But then there are times when I think things are weird, counter-intuitive, and unnecessarily hard.
One of those things is state management.

Let's imagine we have states that we want to share/manage between components to separate concerns and simplify
each component. There are multiple ways to achieve this.
Here is an interactive example:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<figure>
  <Example1 client:load />
  <figcaption className="text-center">
    Example 1, source:
    <a className="text-gray-800 text-opacity-50" href="https://github.com/raphael-arce/raphael-arce.github.io/tree/main/src/content/blog/react-state-management/components/example-1" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<details className="group collapse collapse-plus bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300">
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <summary className="collapse-title font-medium">Example 1 simplified code (without styling or rendering counter)</summary>
  <div className="collapse-content mx-auto w-72 2xs:w-96 xs:w-auto">
    <Example1Simplified />
  </div>
</details>

The standard, <a href="https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components" target="_blank"> recommended way</a> is
to use the <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useState" target="_blank"> useState</a>
hook and _lift the state up_ to a common ancestor. Then, you can prop-drill (or use a <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext" target="_blank"> context</a>)
to pass the state down to the components that need it.

This is implemented in the component <code className="bg-gray-200">BranchA</code>.
The state is declared in <code className="bg-gray-200">BranchA</code>, and its value is passed down
as a prop to <code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveAA</code> and the setter function
to <code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveAB</code>.
However, if you click on the <code className="bg-gray-200">X\*2</code> button, you'll notice that not only
the component <code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveAA</code>,
where the value is used, is re-rendered[^1],
but also <code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveAB</code> and <code className="bg-gray-200">BranchA</code>.

Now, let's take a look at <code className="bg-gray-200">BranchB</code>.
Here, we use the zustand library to manage the state.
We declare the state _outside_ our components and _inject_ it into the components that need it.
This means that only the <code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveBA</code> receives the state's value,
while the <code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveBB</code> receives the setter function.
A significant difference! Thanks to that, only the component <code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveBA</code> is
re-rendered when clicking on the <code className="bg-gray-200">Y\*2</code> button.

Let's look at another example:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<figure>
	<Example2 client:load />
	<figcaption className="text-center">
		Example 2, source:
		<a className="text-gray-800 text-opacity-50" href="https://github.com/raphael-arce/raphael-arce.github.io/tree/main/src/content/blog/react-state-management/components/example-2" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<details className="group collapse collapse-plus bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300">
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <summary className="collapse-title font-medium">Example 2 simplified code (without styling or rendering counter)</summary>
  <div className="collapse-content mx-auto w-72 2xs:w-96 xs:w-auto">
    <Example2Simplified />
  </div>
</details>

Here, the components that read the state
(<code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveAA</code>, <code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveAB</code>)
are further away from the components that update the state
(<code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveBA</code>, <code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveBB</code>).
So we lifted the state up one level further, to the <code className="bg-gray-200">Root</code> component and prop-drilled our
value/setter down to the leaves. And now, the difference: when you click on <code className="bg-gray-200">X\*2</code>,
ALL components are re-rendered. However, when you click on <code className="bg-gray-200">Y\*2</code>, still
only <code className="bg-gray-200">LeaveBA</code> is re-rendered.

Now, imagine having a large application with intricate components, intricate states and intricate effects.
Being able to selectively re-render only the components that need to updating, without relying on additional features
like <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/memo" target="_blank">memo</a>,
is a significant improvement. Simultaneously, it enhances readability (in my opinion) by separating concerns and
breaking down complexity into smaller, more understandable/manageable pieces.

  That _leaves_ me to wonder, why is this not the standard way of doing things?
