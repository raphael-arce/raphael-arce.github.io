In the previous article, we created a static map made up by tiles on a specific zoom level.
But how do we make it interactive?

## Interactivity

In essence, zooming (or panning) on a map is just a manipulation of the map center and the zoom level.
If you can figure out what the new zoom level and the new map center will be after an interaction,
you just need to re-render the map with the these values.

## Zooming

Zooming towards the center of the container is fairly simple.
We just need to change the zoom level and re-render the map, as the center does not change.
However, zooming towards or away from the mouse cursor is a bit more complicated.
We need to calculate the new map center based on the mouse position.

### Zooming towards mouse cursor

When you zoom towards the mouse cursor, the new center of the map will be at midpoint
between the mouse cursor and the old center.

### Zooming away from mouse cursor

When you zoom away from the mouse cursor, it's the other way around.
The mouse cursor is now the midpoint between the old center and the new center.
