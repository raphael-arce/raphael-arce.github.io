React effects are a powerful tool. They allow you to execute a function when some dependencies change, or when the component mounts/unmounts. Originally, they are meant to [synchronize a component with an external system](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects). In my opinion, they are most often misused and complicating everything.

Disclaimer: these are not hard rules, but rather recommendations that usually lead to cleaner code. There are exceptions that justify not following them.

_TLDR_:

- _Avoid useEffect for handling value changes, prefer normal functions._
- _If you can't avoid an effect, extract it into a named hook._

## Avoid useEffect for handling value changes, prefer normal functions

Most often, I see `useEffect` being used to handle chains of computations: _when this value changes, that should happen_ or _when this component mounts, do that_. This mental model is straight forward, easy to remember and simple to use.

In my opinion, using this approach swiftly becomes problematic. I've worked with large applications that had hundreds of effects that would trigger eachother, making them feel non-deterministic. Keeping track of what happened where was insanely difficult. Try to remove an `useEffect` because it looks unnecessary? Watch the whole app collapse. On top of that, this approach made the applications slow down a lot: if a value change triggers a re-rendering of a component, after which an effect is executed, which might trigger another re-rendering of another (or the same) component and so on and so forth is just highly inefficient.

Avoid using `useEffect` for handling chains of computations. `useEffect` is meant to synchronize rendering with _external_ systems. External here means external to React. It should be used very sparesly. Prefer normal function calls.

  <div className="collapse-content mx-auto w-72 2xs:w-[20rem] xs:w-auto">
    <NormalFunctions />
  </div>
</details>

There is a whole article on [You Might Not Need an Effect](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) on the React website for more details.

## If you can't avoid an effect, extract it into a named hook

When there is a valid reason to use an effect, try to extract the logic into a named hook. This helps immensely with readability and maintainability:

  <summary className="collapse-title font-medium">Plain useEffect</summary>
  <div className="collapse-content mx-auto w-72 2xs:w-[20rem] xs:w-auto">
    <UseEffect />
  </div>
</details>

  <summary className="collapse-title font-medium">Named Hook</summary>
  <div className="collapse-content mx-auto w-72 2xs:w-[20rem] xs:w-auto">
    <NamedHook />
  </div>
</details>

## Conclusion

That's it for part 3! Applying these recommendations will significantly simplify handling state management. In the [next part](/blog/leaner-react-part-3), we'll look into effects.
