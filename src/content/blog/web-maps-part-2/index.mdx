In the previous article, we created a static map made up by tiles on a specific zoom level.
But how do we make it interactive?

## Interactivity

In essence, zooming (or panning) on a map is just a manipulation of the map center and the zoom level.
If you can figure out what the new zoom level and the new map center will be after an interaction,
you just need to re-render the map with the these values.

## Zooming

Zooming towards the center of the container is fairly simple.
We just need to change the zoom level and re-render the map, as the center does not change.
However, zooming towards or away from the mouse cursor is a bit more complicated.
We need to calculate the new map center based on the mouse position.

### Zooming towards mouse cursor

When you zoom towards the mouse cursor, the new center of the map will be at midpoint
between the mouse cursor and the old center.

	</video>

</figure>

### Zooming away from mouse cursor

When you zoom away from the mouse cursor, it's the other way around.
The old center is located at the midpoint between mouse cursor and the new center.

### How do we calculate the new center?

If we zoom in, we need to calculate the midpoint between the mouse cursor and the center.
We will calculate the distance in pixels.
Let us take the same map from part 1:

- The center is:<code className="bg-gray-200">(13.4, 52.52)</code>.
- The zoom level is <code className="bg-gray-200">14</code>.
- One tile is <code className="bg-gray-200">256</code> pixels wide and high.
- The map is inside a container of <code className="bg-gray-200">400</code> pixels width
  and <code className="bg-gray-200">300</code> pixels height.
- The center of the container is at <code className="bg-gray-200">(200, 150)</code>.

Using the Web Mercator Projection, these geo-coordinates (on a globe) can be converted
to <code className="bg-gray-200">(2253273.3155555557, 1375543.6427981234)</code> in
cartesian coordinates (on a flat surface). Let's say the mouse
cursor is at <code className="bg-gray-200">(100, 100)</code> inside the container, and we want to zoom
in by <code className="bg-gray-200">1</code> level (to zoom level <code className="bg-gray-200">15</code>).
The midpoint between the mouse cursor at <code className="bg-gray-200">(150, 125)</code>, which
is <code className="bg-gray-200">50</code> pixels to the left and <code className="bg-gray-200">25</code> pixels
up from the center.

So the cartesian coordinates of the new center are:

<div className="w-72 2xs:w-[20rem] xs:w-[26rem] sm:w-[30rem] md:w-auto">
	<Code
		className="bg-gray-200"
		code={`x = 2253273.3155555557 - 50;
x = 2253223.3155555557;

y = 1375543.6427981234 - 25;
y = 1375518.6427981234;`}
lang={"ts"}
/>

</div>

Now, we need to use the web mercator projection to convert these cartesian coordinates to geographic coordinates.

<div className="w-72 2xs:w-[20rem] xs:w-[26rem] sm:w-[30rem] md:w-auto">
  <Example1 />
</div>

If we plug those values back into the algorithm
from <a href="/blog/web-maps-part-1" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, we found a way to zoom in!

How do we zoom out? Well, we just need to use the old center as the midpoint between the mouse cursor and
the new center. Which means, with the same values, old center at <code className="bg-gray-200">(200, 150)</code>, mouse
cursor at <code className="bg-gray-200">(100, 100)</code>, the new center would be at <code className="bg-gray-200">(300, 200)</code>.
In cartesian coordinates, that would be:

<div className="w-72 2xs:w-[20rem] xs:w-[26rem] sm:w-[30rem] md:w-auto">
	<Code
		className="bg-gray-200"
		code={`x = 2253273.3155555557 + 100;
x = 2253373.3155555557;

y = 1375543.6427981234 + 50;
y = 1375593.6427981234;`}
lang={"ts"}
/>

</div>

In geographic coordinates:

<div className="w-72 2xs:w-[20rem] xs:w-[26rem] sm:w-[30rem] md:w-auto">
  <Example2 />
</div>

And that's it! We can now zoom in and out on the map! Here is a working example, click/tap to zoom in,
double click/double tap to zoom out:
