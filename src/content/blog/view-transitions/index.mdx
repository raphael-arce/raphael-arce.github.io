I just learned that you can activate [view transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) in multi-page applications using only this in your stylesheet:

```
@view-transition {
  navigation: auto;
}
```

And if you want to make sure that your view transitions are accessible, you can wrap it in a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query:

```
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @view-transition {
    navigation: auto;
  }
}
```

Note: it is [not supported by firefox yet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API#css.at-rules.view-transition), but it works in chromium- and webkit-based browsers.
